          originated from China, and people of other races blame the Chinese for starting this pandemic.  This<br>caused other races to
          perform violent actions and crimes against them.  Three in ten Chinese people experienced<br>discrimination in the five years preceding 2019, or the years after the pandemic started.<br>
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese people mostly experience discrimination in a store, bank, or restaurant.  When it came to discrimination,
          <br>Chinese people most often experience discrimation on race, ethnicity, and language.  Other reasons for the
          <br>discrimination against them are physical appearance, sex, age, and gender identity.</p><img src="../images/graph.png" style="height: 400px; width: 800px;">
          <p>About one-third of Asians know another Asian who has been attacked or threatened after the pandemic.  Chinese<br>women are also most likely to be threatened or attacked.  Chinese people between the ages of 18-29 are also most<br>likely to be threatened or attacked.
